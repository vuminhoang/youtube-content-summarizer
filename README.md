# Youtube Content Summarizer 
In this repo, I created a YouTube Content Summarize System that can create Vietnamese highlighted notes from YouTube videos that can extract the transcript. I also finetune the pre-trained model ViT5 for downstream task summarization.

# Traning
I used the Huggingface training style in the final-training-summarize file, you can use my pre-trained models at checkpoints that mentioned below.
