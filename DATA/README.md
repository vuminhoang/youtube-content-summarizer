The data set is remade from WikiLingua with longer labels; however, it is intended only for research purposes to create more comprehensive summaries and is not meant for commercial use or to damage the original data.
I have also used some data augmentation techniques for text, such as back-translation with googletrans from pyvi, and sentence rephrasing with the Gemini 1.0 API.
