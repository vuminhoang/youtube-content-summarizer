The data set is remade from WikiLingua with longer labels; however, it is intended only for research purposes to create more comprehensive summaries and is not meant for commercial use or to damage the original data.
I have also used some data augmentation techniques for text, such as back-translation with Googletrans from pyvi, and sentence rephrasing with the Gemini 1.0 API.

You can try augmenting the data using the Gemini API on Colab. You may refer to my instruction file for guidance.
